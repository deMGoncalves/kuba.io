# Description

The `Description` package is responsible for managing the description of the web page. It provides a convenient way to set and update the page description dynamically, allowing developers to control what appears in the `<meta>` tag for the description.

### Usage

The `Description` package provides a class called `Description`, which can be imported and used in your application. Here's how you can use it:

```js
import Description from '@standard/description'

// To set the initial content of the description
Description.change('This is my web application.')

// To update the description content dynamically
Description.change('New page description.')
```

### How It Works

The `Description` class is decorated with the `@paint` decorator, which associates it with the `view` module for rendering purposes. This allows the `Description` class to be used as a component and its view to be rendered in the application.

The `Description` class contains a private property `#content` that holds the current description content. The `content` getter provides a way to access the description content and ensures that the default value is used if no content has been set.

The static method `change(newContent)` allows you to update the description content dynamically. Simply call `Description.change('New Description')` to change the description content.

Please note that the actual rendering of the description is handled by the view module, and you don't need to worry about that part in your application code.

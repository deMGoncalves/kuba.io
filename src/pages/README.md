### Introduction

The Page Workflow provides a standardized approach to building new pages in your web application. It covers various aspects, including page structure, routing, components, data fetching, styling, and testing. By following this workflow, you can create pages that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Page Workflow, make sure you have a basic understanding of the underlying technologies used in your project, such as JavaScript, React, or any other framework you are using. Familiarize yourself with the project's codebase and existing page components.

### Page Structure

When creating a new page, follow a consistent page structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. A typical page structure may look like this:

```js
src/
|-- pages/
|   |-- PageName/
|   |   |-- components/
|   |   |-- home.js
|   |   |-- home.test.js
|   |   |-- index.js
|   |   |-- storage.js
|   |   |-- style.js
|   |   |-- view.js
```

- `components/`: If the page requires specific components that are only used on this page, place them in the components directory.
- `home.js`: The main page component that represents the entire page layout and structure. It should import and use necessary components and styles specific to this page.
- `home.test.js`: Test file for the page component. Include unit tests to ensure the page works as expected.
- `index.js`:
- `storage.js`: If the page requires specific data fetching or data handling logic, place them in the storage file.
- `style.js`: Styles specific to this page. You can use CSS-in-JS libraries or plain CSS.
- `view.js`:

### Routing

Ensure that the new page is properly integrated into the application's routing system. Use the appropriate routing mechanism provided by your framework (e.g., React Router for React applications) to create the necessary routes for the new page.

### Components

Follow the principles of component-based architecture when designing components for the new page. Create reusable and modular components whenever possible to promote code reusability and maintainability.

### Data Fetching

If the page requires data from an API or any external source, implement proper data fetching and handling mechanisms. Use libraries like Axios or Fetch API to make API requests and manage data using state management libraries if needed.

### Styling

Adhere to the project's styling conventions and use the preferred styling approach (e.g., CSS, CSS-in-JS, SCSS) when styling the new page. Keep the styling modular and maintain consistency with the overall application design.

### Testing

Write comprehensive unit tests for the new page component to ensure that it functions correctly and efficiently. Use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library to conduct unit testing.

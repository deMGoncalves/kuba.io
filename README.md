# Kuba

Kuba is a project that was created with the purpose of simplifying the way we develop web applications. As developers, we often encounter complex problems that seem to have no simple solution. But is it really necessary to complicate things so much?

The goal of Kuba is to show that it's possible to develop web applications in a simpler way without compromising code quality and efficiency. To achieve this, the project utilizes modern JavaScript concepts, such as the use of decorators to manage component lifecycle.

Additionally, Kuba was created with a philosophy that values simplicity and ease of use. We believe that clean and organized code is essential for the maintenance and evolution of a software project.

In summary, Kuba is a JavaScript project that aims to simplify the way we develop web applications, valuing simplicity, efficiency, and collaboration among developers.

## Kuba: Simplifying Front-End Development

Welcome to Kuba, the JavaScript framework that revolutionizes web application development. Are you tired of grappling with complex problems and convoluted code? With Kuba, we believe that simplicity is the key to scalable, beautiful, and efficient front-end development.

### Why Choose Kuba?

Kuba was born out of the desire to simplify web application development without sacrificing code quality or efficiency. We leverage modern JavaScript concepts, including the use of decorators to manage component lifecycle, to empower developers with an intuitive and streamlined development experience.

Our philosophy centers around simplicity and ease of use. We firmly believe that clean, organized code is the foundation for maintaining and evolving successful software projects. With Kuba, you can build web applications that embody these principles.

### The Kuba Manifesto

At Kuba, we have a manifesto that guides our development process:

- **Simplicity is the key to scalability**: By embracing simplicity, we unlock the potential for scalable and maintainable applications.
- **Small is beautiful**: We embrace the elegance and power of small, focused components that work harmoniously together.
- **Imperfect is human**: We understand that perfection is unattainable, and we value progress over perfection. We embrace imperfections as opportunities to learn and grow.

### Constructive Units for Well-Structured Applications

Kuba's framework comprises several key components that work in harmony to create well-structured web applications:

- **View**: The View component handles the rendering of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring the correct display of the user interface. It empowers you to create stunning and responsive front-end experiences.
- **Root Aggregate**: The Root Aggregate component models the application's domain, defining its core functionality and data structure. It consists of two vital parts:
  - **Action**: The Action component manipulates the state of the Root Aggregate. It handles user interactions, triggers events, and performs actions that modify the application's data and behavior.
  - **State**: The State component represents the current state of the Root Aggregate. It holds the data and information necessary for the application to operate. The State is updated by the Action component and utilized by the View component to render the appropriate user interface.
- **Advice**: The Advice component plays a crucial role in managing cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, metrics, security, data updates, and formatting. By encapsulating these concerns, the Advice component ensures consistency throughout the application and promotes code reusability.

This modular approach enables a clear separation of concerns, facilitating maintainable and scalable architectures for your web applications.

### How It Works

Kuba provides a comprehensive set of resources and functionalities to simplify the application creation process. Our framework offers a simple and efficient architecture, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic without getting bogged down by technical details.

### Island Architecture: Unleash JavaScript Control

Kuba's architecture is based on the innovative concept of "Island Architecture" by Katie Sylor-Miller. It empowers you to maintain JavaScript control within your web application, even when faced with static elements such as navigation links or images with text.

The island architecture renders HTML pages on the server while injecting placeholders into dynamic areas. These placeholders are then filled with independent components on the client, reusing the initial HTML generated by the server.

By leveraging the power of island architecture, Kuba simplifies web application development, emphasizing simplicity and efficiency. It enables the server to handle static content, while JavaScript is loaded only for interactive components.

Experience better performance as the majority of your site transforms into static HTML. Moreover, the island architecture prioritizes important content and ensures your pages are search engine optimized (SEO).

Please note that while the island architecture brings significant benefits, it may not be suitable for highly interactive applications.

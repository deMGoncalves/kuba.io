# Kuba

Kuba is a project that was created with the purpose of simplifying the way we develop web applications. As developers, we often encounter complex problems that seem to have no simple solution. But is it really necessary to complicate things so much?

The goal of Kuba is to show that it's possible to develop web applications in a simpler way without compromising code quality and efficiency. To achieve this, the project utilizes modern JavaScript concepts, such as the use of decorators to manage component lifecycle.

Additionally, Kuba was created with a philosophy that values simplicity and ease of use. We believe that clean and organized code is essential for the maintenance and evolution of a software project.

In summary, Kuba is a JavaScript project that aims to simplify the way we develop web applications, valuing simplicity, efficiency, and collaboration among developers.

### Manifesto

The Kuba manifesto is a declaration of principles that guide the development of the project:

- Simplicity is the key to scalability
- Small is beautiful
- Imperfect is human

### Constructive Units

The Kuba framework consists of several key components that work together to create a well-structured web application:

- **View**: The View component is responsible for rendering the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript of the application. It handles the presentation layer and ensures that the user interface is displayed correctly.
- **Root Aggregate**: The Root Aggregate component is responsible for modeling the application's domain. It defines the core functionality and data structure of the application. Within the Root Aggregate, there are two important parts:
  - **Action**: The Action component is responsible for manipulating the state of the Root Aggregate. It handles user interactions, triggers events, and performs actions that modify the application's data and behavior.
  - **State**: The State component represents the current state of the Root Aggregate. It holds the data and information that the application needs to operate. The State is updated by the Action component and is used by the View component to render the appropriate user interface.
- **Advice**: The Advice component plays a crucial role in managing cross-cutting concerns of the application. It handles tasks such as logging, metrics, security, data updates, and formatting. The Advice component ensures that these concerns are addressed consistently throughout the application and promotes code reusability.

By dividing the responsibilities into these constructive units, Kuba promotes a clear separation of concerns and facilitates a modular and maintainable architecture for web applications.

### How It Works

Kuba is a web development tool that provides a set of resources and functionalities to facilitate the application creation process. It offers a simple and efficient architecture, allowing developers to focus on implementing business logic without worrying too much about technical details.

### Island Architecture

The Kuba architecture is based on the concept of "Ilha" (Island Architecture), created by Katie Sylor-Miller. This approach allows you to control JavaScript in a web application, even when there are static elements such as navigation links or images with text.

The central idea of the island architecture is to render HTML pages on the server and add placeholders in dynamic areas. These placeholders are later filled with independent components on the client, reusing the initial HTML generated by the server.

The Kuba architecture simplifies web application development, valuing simplicity and efficiency. It enables rendering static content on the server, while JavaScript is loaded only for components that require interactivity.

With Kuba, you can achieve better performance as most of the site is transformed into static HTML. Additionally, the island architecture prioritizes important content and makes pages SEO-friendly.

However, this approach may not be suitable for highly interactive applications.

The island architecture is an innovation that brings significant benefits to web application development. With Kuba, you can simplify the development process, maintain clean code, and ensure efficient performance for your project.
